# react-project
Learning react

## My goals
+ Learn react running on Node.js
+ Originally thinking bootstrap, but maybe PolymerElements?
+ Matrix manipulation
    + Transform
    + Rotate
    + Project on to a surface
    + Scale
+ Animate from original to transformed matrix
    + Animate.js?
    + Depends if I use Polymer..
